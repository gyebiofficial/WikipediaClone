        Annie Dove Denmark (1887–1974) was an American music educator and 
        academic administrator who was the fifth president of Anderson 
        College (now Anderson University) in Anderson, South Carolina, 
        from 1928 to 1953. A talented musician in her youth, Denmark attended 
        what is now Meredith College and graduated with an artist's diploma 
        in piano in 1908. She began teaching piano at Anderson in 1917. She is commonly,
        though incorrectly, cited as the first woman president of a college or university 
        in South Carolina. She oversaw Anderson's transition from a four-year college to a
        two-year junior college, making it the first junior college in the state.
        The school's debt was paid off by the South Carolina Baptist Convention in May 1938, 
        and attendance increased for several years after World War II when the school enrolled
        more men than it ever had since becoming co-educational in 1931. She left office in
        May 1953, concluding a 25-year presidency that remains the longest in Anderson's history. (Full article...)

        Echinaster sepositus, also known as the Mediterranean red sea star, is a species of starfish in the 
        Echinasteridae family. It is found in the eastern Atlantic Ocean, including the Mediterranean Sea and
        the French side of the English Channel, at depths of up to 250 m (820 ft). It has a wide range of habitats 
        including rocky, sandy and muddy bottoms, and sea-grass meadows formed of Posidonia oceanica and
        Zostera. E. sepositus has five relatively slender arms, with a diameter of up to 20 cm, or occasionally
        as much as 30 cm. It is a bright orange-red in colour with a soapy surface texture and a surface dotted
        with evenly spaced pits from which the animal can extend its deep red gills (papula). This E. sepositus
        individual was photographed in the Atlantic Ocean in Arrábida Natural Park, Portugal.
